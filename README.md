The Friends Server Oversight Committee was established in September, year 2020 to bring order and prosperity to the Server. This Committee has jurisdiction over all properties controlled with power vested within the People’s Assembly of the Friends Server, unless the said entity is under the control of a separate regulative body.

This Committee shall preside over all matters regarding the operation of the Server. A committee of Members of the Server will vote on proposals, which may be submitted by any member(s) of the Friends Server. If a judgement is felt to be unfair, any Member may request the FSOC reconsider their proposal, and if the Committee feels that it is necessary, a previous resolution may be overturned in favor of a newer Proposal set forth by a member of the People’s Assembly.
