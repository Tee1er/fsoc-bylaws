                The main form of control the Friends Server Oversight Committee shall have over the operations of the Friends Server
                will be that of legislative proposals. These proposals shall have absolute authority over all aspects of the Friends Server's operation,
                and have the right to change any and all aspects of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any Member of the People's Assembly shall have the power to submit a legislative proposal for review by the Assembly.
                These proposals may be submitted in the #legislative-proposals text channel, or by any other acceptable and reasonable means.
                If the Institutional Review Board deems the proposal as worthy of consideration by the full Committee, it is the duty of the IR Board
                to communicate this to the Secretary of the People's Assembly so that they may have the ability to include such proposal in the Agenda of the Friends Server
                Oversight Committee.
            </p>
            <p>
                During a valid Meeting of the FSOC, each item must be considered in order, with the proper protocol detailed in <a href='section2.html'>Section 2</a> used.
                If an item is resolved, it is the duty of the Supreme Leader to execute the actions desired within the timeframe provided by the Resolution.
                The Supreme Leader reserves the power to veto a decision by the Committee, but this is highly discouraged due to the undermining of democratic & bureaucratic processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any item may be considered resolved if a vote is held during a valid Meeting of the Oversight Committee, and if a majority of its members are in support of the proposal.
                In the rare case of a tie or unclear outcome, the matter shall be settled with a consultation of the Almighty and Wise MEE6.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Legislative Appeal process may be effected by any Member of the Peopleâ€™s Assembly, if they strongly believe that the rejection of a Proposal was unfair and should be reviewed. 
                In this case, a Proposal nullifying or modifying the previous may be resubmitted to the Institutional Review Board, and included in the Agenda, upon which the Proposal Review Process shall continue as usual.
