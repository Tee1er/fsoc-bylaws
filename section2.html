            </div>
            <p>A meeting of the Friends Server Oversight Committee shall be the only legal time and place where laws and regulations shall be made. 
                A meeting shall be defined as : any gathering where three or more members of the Friends Server Oversight Committee are present, and where a majority of Committee members present acknowledge
                the meeting's existence.
            <p>
            <p>
                The review of Agenda items should be the main focus of each Meeting. The submission of items is detailed within Section 1 : Legislative Process.
                Each item must be considered in succession, with each Item being carefully examined and discussed. The structure that the review of a single item
                should take shall not be set by law, but each of the tasks listed below <em>must</em> be completed before the next Agenda item is begun.
                <div id = 'em-box'>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Review of the background information provided.</li>
                        <li>Public discussion & comment.</li>
                        <li>Review of the proposed resolution.</li>
                        <li>A vote on the matter.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </p>
            <p>
                The background information & resolution provided by the legislator must be read by the Member presiding over the Meeting, but they may be communicated separately or as a union.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the review of each item, public discussion must take place, preferably before the voting processes have initiated. The member presiding over the Meeting will announce to the Members present
                that a public comment session has begun. A public comment session may be opened only by the Member presiding over the Meeting, but it is within the rights of any Member to request such a Session.
                All members that desire to comment on the legislation are entitled to do so. If all Members who desire to comment have concluded, any Member, may, at any time, close the Session. No Member shall speak
                for longer than fifteen minutes, in order to prevent a situation where a Member would speak for unnecessarily long to block legislation from passage. <!--Prevent the filibuster!--> 
            </p>
            <p>
                If all other tasks have been completed, the voting process may begin. The Presiding Member shall post or read the identifier of the resolution part(s) (e.g. PART 1) and the resolution. They shall
                prompt the other Members to begin voting, expressing their support or disapproval using the keywords "Yea" or "Nay", respectively representing "Yes, I am in support of the proposal", and "No, I am not
                in support of the proposal." No member present shall be exempted from voting for any reason.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once all items on the Agenda have been reviewed, all Members are satisfied, and a time for the next Meeting has been agreed-upon, the Committee may disband.
            </p>
            <p>
                In extraordinary cases, the Friends Server Oversight Committee shall reserve the right to convene in an emergency meeting. If the majority of Committee Members are in agreement that the circumstances
                are extremely urgent, an emergency Meeting may be convened, formed of the same Members and governed by the same protocols as with a regular Meeting - identical in all respects except for the nature
                of its formation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any member, at any time, may request to be excluded from the meeting by the Member presiding over the Meeting (by default the Secretary of the People’s Assembly), and if their request is granted, 
                the Member may be exempted from the requirement of participation within the Meeting. If the Member desires to join the active Meeting again, they may request to be Included. The Member presiding 
                over the Meeting is legally obliged to grant their request.
            </p>
            <p>
                Members are requested to use proper grammar during meetings, to reflect the professionalism and seriousness of the matter. This includes, but is not limited to refraining from the use of “emojis.” and “emoticons.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Members should clear their status messages, etc, to make certain that their profile does not end up being a distraction or an embarrassment. In addition, Members should set their status to Online if they are 
                participating in the Meeting.
