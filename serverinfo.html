                The FSOC Discord server is, of course, the main meeting space for the Oversight Committee. It contains four channels, <b>#fsoc-meetings</b>, <b>#legislative-proposals</b>,
                <b>#discussion</b>, and <b>#other</b>. These four channels each have distinct usage cases, outlined below.
            </p>
            <p>
                The channel <b>#fsoc-meetings</b> is the official meeting space of the Committee. Messages sent in her are kept as official records, and the channel is cleared
                after each meeting. Logs are available in the <b>#other</b> channel. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The channel <b>#legislative-proposals</b> is solely for the submission of legislative proposals - all discussion on submitted proposals is to be kept to either
                <b>#discussion</b> or <b>#other</b>. Legislative proposals should be detailed; background information & a resolution must be provided.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>#discussion</b> and <b>#other</b> are used, respectively, for the discussion of the operation, regulations, and other aspects of the Friends Server Oversight Committee, 
                and for other topics related to the Committee, but that do not fit into any of the other categories. Please exercise discretion, as the main Friends Server will almost always
                be a more appropriate medium.
